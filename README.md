Guitarwebsite
=============

working on guitar site


11/3 - 

	Decided to start adding guitar images on to the site.

	Scale 11 guitar image wouldn't open in photoshop, so had to use some css properties to adjust it.

	Have all the images hidden, and planning to add some jQuery scripts to have them pop up when clicking a scale length.
